# How-To-Be-A-Stable-Workaholic-Planner

For this homework challenge, I had to do a workplace planner for the day! On this application, the user will open a page with a few blocks with a different time on and a date at the top. In each box you can input text which can be stored on the website and local storage for the user to use as a planner. The boxes for each time can change colour according to the time it is during the day. It will give you three colours for when the time has passed, when the time is in the future or when the time is now. A Clear Storage button is also put at the top for the user to delete their content on the page.
